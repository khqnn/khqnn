Master's Thesis: Automated Pest Detection in Crops using Deep Learning
- **Abstract:**  
  Crops are a vital part of the economy and livelihood, making crop protection crucial. In this research, we explored the application of deep learning techniques for automating the detection of pests in crops. Using the IP102 dataset and ensemble pre-trained deep CNN models, we developed a weighted ensemble technique with learnable parameters. Additionally, we utilized pretrained vision transformers to classify stem rust, leaf rust, and healthy wheat from a small dataset sourced from the ICLR challenge. Through experimentation with CNN architectures and ViT models, we demonstrated the effectiveness of large-scale pretrained vision transformers on small datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Our research highlights the importance of leveraging pretrained models and the transferability of features learned from ImageNet21 in agricultural applications.

- **Key Contributions**  
  * Developed a weighted ensemble technique with learnable parameters for pest detection.
  * Demonstrated the effectiveness of pretrained vision transformers on small agricultural datasets.
  * Achieved competitive performance in the ICLR challenge through the use of ViT models pretrained on ImageNet21.
