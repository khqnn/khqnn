Master's Thesis: Automated Pest Detection in Crops using Deep Learning
- **Abstract:**  
  Crops are a vital part of the economy and livelihood, making crop protection crucial. In this research, we explored the application of deep learning techniques for automating the detection of pests in crops. Using the IP102 dataset and ensemble pre-trained deep CNN models, we developed a weighted ensemble technique with learnable parameters. Additionally, we utilized pretrained vision transformers to classify stem rust, leaf rust, and healthy wheat from a small dataset sourced from the ICLR challenge. Through experimentation with CNN architectures and ViT models, we demonstrated the effectiveness of large-scale pretrained vision transformers on small datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Our research highlights the importance of leveraging pretrained models and the transferability of features learned from ImageNet21 in agricultural applications.

- **Key Contributions**  
  * Developed a weighted ensemble technique with learnable parameters for pest detection.
  * Demonstrated the effectiveness of pretrained vision transformers on small agricultural datasets.
  * Achieved competitive performance in the ICLR challenge through the use of ViT models pretrained on ImageNet21.

- **Learnings**  
  * Pretrained vision transformers are effective for small datasets in agricultural contexts.
  * Features learned from ImageNet21 are transferable to diverse datasets, such as wheat plant images.

### KidSafe
- **Description**  
  KidSafe is an application designed to provide a safe environment for children to watch YouTube videos. It utilizes the YouTube API to curate a selection of kid-friendly content.

- **Role and Responsibilities**  
  As a senior software engineer for the KidSafe project, my responsibilities included implementing features, integrating APIs, and ensuring child safety and usability.

- **Challenges Faced**  
  Initially, the app was designed to allow parents to manually select videos for their children, but this approach proved cumbersome. Integrating functionality to automatically include all videos from a YouTube channel posed a challenge, as the YouTube API does not provide direct access to fetch videos by channel name.

- **Solutions Implemented**  
  Developed a Python service to overcome the challenge by utilizing web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup to fetch the YouTube channel ID using the channel name. Once the channel ID was obtained, the YouTube API was invoked recursively to fetch all videos associated with the channel. This solution provided a seamless way to include all videos from a specified YouTube channel in the KidSafe app, enhancing user experience and content accessibility for parents and children.


### Notifications Service
- **Description**  
  The Notifications Service is designed to deliver up to 1,000 notifications per minute efficiently. It utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for message delivery, Cassandra for data storage, and supports features such as retry mechanisms and recurring/one-time notifications.

- **Role and Responsibilities**  
  As a senior software engineer for the Notifications Service project, my responsibilities included architecting the system, optimizing performance, and ensuring reliable delivery of notifications.

- **Challenges Faced**  
  The partition key was set as the job_id, and the sort key was the next notification trigger time. However, the presence of the same next notification trigger time in multiple partitions led to slower query performance, as queries for next jobs to be executed were scanned across all partitions.

- **Solutions Implemented**  
  To address the query performance issue, we redesigned the data model by setting the next notification timestamp as the partition key and the job_id as the sort key. This ensured that all notifications scheduled for the same time would be stored within the same partition. As a result, querying for next notifications to be triggered became more efficient, improving overall system performance and reducing latency.



### Google Map Scraper
- **Description**  
  The Google Map Scraper is a tool designed to extract information about stores from Google Maps based on location and store type. It is built using Python, with Beautiful Soup and Selenium utilized for web scraping.

- **Role and Responsibilities**  
  As the sole creator and developer of the Google Map Scraper, I orchestrated all facets of the project, from conceptualization to implementation. My responsibilities encompassed designing the scraping process, integrating essential web scraping libraries, and fine-tuning data extraction mechanisms. This project underscores my adeptness in independently driving and delivering complex technical solutions.

- **Challenges Faced**  
  The dynamic rendering of Google Maps posed challenges for web scraping, as Beautiful Soup could not access dynamically loaded content.

- **Solutions Implemented**  
  To overcome the limitation of Beautiful Soup, Selenium was employed to open a browser and wait for the complete rendering of the Google Maps webpage. Once the page was fully loaded, metadata for the stores (such as location and store type) was extracted using Selenium. Subsequently, Beautiful Soup was utilized to iterate through the metadata and extract detailed information for each store, including address, star ratings, phone numbers, and photos. This combined approach ensured comprehensive data extraction from Google Maps despite the dynamic rendering challenges.
